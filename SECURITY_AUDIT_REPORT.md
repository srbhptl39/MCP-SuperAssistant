## Security Audit Report

### Introduction

This report summarizes the findings of a security audit conducted on the MCP SuperAssistant project. The audit included a review of the project's dependencies, an analysis of the code for common vulnerabilities, and an examination of the authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Findings

#### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities

A `pnpm audit` revealed several vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, including:

* **2 critical vulnerabilities** in the `pbkdf2` package.
* **1 high vulnerability** in the `@eslint/plugin-kit` package.
* **6 moderate vulnerabilities** in the `esbuild` and `vite` packages.
* **2 low vulnerabilities** in the `brace-expansion` package.

**Action Taken:** All vulnerable dependencies were updated to their patched versions using `pnpm up`.

#### 2. Sensitive Information

The codebase was scanned for hardcoded API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data. The project uses environment variables to manage sensitive information like Firebase API keys and Google Analytics secrets, which is a good security practice. No hardcoded secrets were found.

#### 3. Common Vulnerabilities

The code was analyzed for common security vulnerabilities, including:

* **SQL Injection:** No evidence of SQL usage was found, so this is not a concern.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code does not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and a basic HTML sanitization function is in place. However, it is recommended to use a more robust library like DOMPurify for sanitization.
* **Insecure Direct Object References:** No instances of insecure direct object references were identified.

#### 4. Privacy

The application collects analytics data, including user agent, language, and screen resolution. This is standard practice for many applications, but it's important to be transparent with users about what data is collected and how it is used. The use of a randomly generated client ID is a good privacy-preserving measure.

#### 5. Authentication and Authorization

The application uses Firebase Authentication, which is a secure and reliable authentication solution. The use of Firebase App Check with reCAPTCHA v3 is a good security measure to prevent abuse.

### Recommendations

1.  **Use a robust HTML sanitization library.** While the existing `sanitizeHtml` function provides basic protection, a library like DOMPurify would offer more comprehensive protection against XSS attacks.
2.  **Maintain a regular dependency audit schedule.** Regularly running `pnpm audit` and updating dependencies will help to ensure that the project is not vulnerable to known exploits.
3.  **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).** A CSP would provide an additional layer of security against XSS and other injection attacks.
4.  **Review and update the privacy policy.** Ensure that the privacy policy accurately reflects the data that is collected and how it is used.

### Conclusion

The MCP SuperAssistant project has a solid security foundation. The use of environment variables for secrets, Firebase Authentication, and App Check are all good security practices. By addressing the recommendations in this report, the project can further improve its security posture.
